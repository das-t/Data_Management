Project Name: Database Management System (DBMS)

Original code: Please refer to the folders above for the "unimplemented" code. Due to the agreement with the Professor, the implemented code is not public and may be provided upon request. (Please see the bottom of the file for more details.)

Project Description: The project requires us to design and implement a database system which is able to manage records in the API data format. The functions of the DBMS include creating tables and indexes and answering SQL queries. The project is divided into four parts. Each part is described in "Project Description.pdf".

Supplemental Information:

- The project provided signatures of the functions. Our task was to design our DBMS and implement the functions.

- The project was developed in the "test-driven" method, that is, each part had to pass through a bunch of tests designed by the TA to be considered successful.

- The project was co-worked with my teammate, Chun-Kai (Kyle) Chan. "It takes teamwork to make dream work." Without his help the huge project would not have been completed as scheduled. Below is his LinkedIn page:

How to compile and run in Linux:
Download the files into a folder.
In the terminal, change the directory to that folder (should include makefile).
Type "make" to compile the code.
And then type “./<test_name>” (e.g., “./rbftest1”) to run the test.
Since the code in this repository is "unimplemented", you should see an error message such as "Creating the file failed."
If you have a valid reason to view the implemented code (e.g., you are a recruiter or an interviewer), please contact me at yidarl@uci.edu.
Thank you!
